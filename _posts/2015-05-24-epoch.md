Hello, new blog. Hello, world! 

![catatan]({{ site.baseurl }}/asset/2015-05-24-catatan.jpg)

So, nah. This blog is not about cats. At least not exclusively. It's about ... well ... none. Nothing thematic at all that I can presently think about. I just love the idea of writing and publishing non-code stuff in `git`. Might as well give it a try.

Hopefully I'll have enough interesting things to say later. :sweat_smile:

See you in a few!
